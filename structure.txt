Scoring mechanism
data => baseScore    -    represents the base score for the level
        bonusPoints  -   represents any additional points earned during the level
        timePenalty  -   represents a penalty for taking too much time to complete the level.


Time-Based Bonus Points
- award points based on the amount of time remaining on the timer when the level is completed. 

timeBonusPoints = maxTimeBonusPoints * (1 - timeRatio)

In this formula, maxTimeBonusPoints represents the maximum bonus points that can be earned for completing the level quickly, and timeRatio represents the ratio of time taken to complete the level to the maximum allowed time. The timeRatio value will be between 0 and 1, with 0 representing completing the level within the maximum allowed time and 1 representing taking the full maximum allowed time to complete the level.

You can adjust the maxTimeBonusPoints value and the specific time limit for your game to suit your needs.

Difficulty-Based Bonus Points
- award bonus points for completing the level on a higher difficulty level. 

difficultyBonusPoints = baseBonusPoints * difficultyMultiplier
